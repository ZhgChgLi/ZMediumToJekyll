You can include images and other resources in the /assets directory. Also, if you would like to remove the ZMediumToMarkdown watermark located at the bottom of the post, you may do so. I don’t mind. You can edit the Ruby file at tools/optimize_markdown.rb and uncomment lines 10-12. This will automatically remove the ZMediumToMarkdown watermark at the end of all posts during Jekyll build time. Since ZMediumToMarkdown is not an official tool and Medium does not provide a public API for it, I cannot guarantee that the parser target will not change in the future. However, I have tried to test it for as many cases as possible. If you encounter any rendering errors or Jekyll build errors, please feel free to create an issue and I will fix them as soon as possible." } ]
